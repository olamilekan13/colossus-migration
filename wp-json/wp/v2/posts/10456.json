IRCC has made the eligibility criteria for a Spouse Open Work Permit strict to limit the number of people who apply. Many of these criteria are put in place to ensure applicants have a legitimate reason to come to Canada and work. Applicants who do not meet IRCC\u2019s requirements are typically rejected.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Let\u2019s look at some common Canada Spousal Open Work Permit rejection reasons.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;1. Failure to Prove Genuineness of Relationship<br \/>\n&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Spouse Open Work Permit applicants must prove that they are in a genuine relationship with their spouse who is working or studying in Canada. Presenting a marriage certificate may be sufficient in some cases, but it is best to provide additional evidence if you have gotten married only recently.<\/p>\n<p>If you are in a common-law partnership with a partner working or studying in Canada, you must provide additional evidence as you won\u2019t have a marriage certificate.<\/p>\n<p>This evidence can include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Photographs of you and your spouse or common-law partner. These photographs should include other family members and friends to demonstrate that the relationship is publicly known.<\/li>\n<li>Proof of children together. This can be provided in the form of birth certificates confirming the child\u2019s parents\u2019 names.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;2.

You can provide this financial proof in the form of financial documents such as bank statements from the last six months.<\/p>\n<p>Applicants who fail to provide proof of funds and those with little money in their bank accounts are likely to be rejected. This is because IRCC wants to ensure the people who come to Canada can support themselves and won\u2019t become a burden on the country\u2019s welfare system.<\/p>\n<p>IRCC has not disclosed the minimum amount of funds applicants require. However, it is best to maintain a minimum of $13,000 CAD in your account before applying for a SOWP.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;3.

IRCC put this requirement in place to avoid having people stay in Canada after their work permit expires or after their spouse\u2019s work or education has ended. Many people have their Spouse Open Work Permit rejected for failing to provide sufficient proof they will go home once their status expires.<\/p>\n<p>You can demonstrate your intent to leave Canada by providing <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/cover-letter-sop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a strong cover letter<\/a><\/strong>. This cover letter can discuss your family ties to your home country. It should also include information about any businesses or properties you own there.
