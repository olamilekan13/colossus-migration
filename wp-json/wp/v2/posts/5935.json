This program issues <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/canada-work-visa-options-and-processes\/\">work permits<\/a> to workers from a number of countries. Such programs are especially popular with <strong>Indian nationals<\/strong> that wish to work in Canada and further their careers. However, there are plenty of other programs that also offer work permits for Indian workers.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s examine the various options for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/category\/india\/\"><strong>getting a Canada work visa for Indians<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>International Mobility Program<\/h2>\n<p>The majority of Canadian work permits issued to foreign nationals are provided under the International Mobility Program (IMP). This program has grown to become incredibly popular over the years as it does not require applicants to obtain a Labour Market Impact Assessment, a requirement that can be difficult for many to complete.<\/p>\n<p>The IMP itself was initially created to stimulate Canada&#8217;s economy with the help of foreign workers that wished to contribute to the labour pool in various industries. This program issues both closed and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/open-work-permit-2\/\"><strong>open work permits<\/strong><\/a>. Typical processing times for a work permit under this program is approximately two weeks.<\/p>\n<h2>Post-Graduate Work Permits<\/h2>\n<p>One of the work permits issued under the IMP is a post-graduate work permit. As the name implies, this is a work permit issued to students after completing their studies. Thousands of <strong>Indian students come to Canada for studies<\/strong> every year. These students can then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/how-to-extend-a-post-graduate-work-permit-in-canada\/\"><strong>apply for a post-graduate work permit (PGWP)<\/strong><\/a> once they complete their studies.<\/p>\n<p>This PGWP is an open work permit that allows students to work in Canada temporarily after graduating. They can then use the work experience they have gained during that period towards obtaining permanent residency.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Indian<\/strong> nationals who wish to apply for a post-graduate work permit will first need to enrol in an eligible program minimum of 8 months in length. This program should be offered by a designated learning institution in the country.<\/p>\n<h2>Intra-Company Transfers<\/h2>\n<p>Indian workers that are currently working for companies with parent companies, subsidiaries, or branches in Canada be eligible for a work permit via the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/all-about-intra-company-transferee-work-permit\/\">Intra-Company Transfer Program<\/a>. If you want to apply for a work permit under these programs, you should look up companies in India that fit these requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Indian workers are eligible to apply under this program if they belong to any of the following three categories:<\/p>\n<h3><strong><u>Workers <\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This category is for workers with &#8220;specialized knowledge&#8221; of their company&#8217;s products or services. This also includes advanced expertise in their company&#8217;s procedures.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><u>Senior Managers<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This category is for employees who manage some or all company work and supervise other managers or lower-level employees.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><u>Executives<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This category is specifically for workers in managerial roles with their company. These employees should receive supervision only from high-level executives above them.<\/p>\n<h2>Significant Benefit Work Permit<\/h2>\n<p>The aforementioned programs have strict requirements that applicants must abide by if they wish to be eligible for a work permit. The <strong>Significant Benefit Work Permit<\/strong> work stands out because it relies on immigration officers&#8217; discretion regarding your ability to contribute to Canada&#8217;s economy and culture.<\/p>\n<h2>Temporary Foreign Worker Program<\/h2>\n<p>Many <strong>Indian nationals apply for work permits<\/strong> through the temporary foreign worker program (TFWP). This category was created to help Canadian companies fill labour pool shortages in their industry. Applicants who wish to apply for a work permit under this program must possess a valid job offer and complete a Labour Market Impact Assessment. This Labour Market Impact Assessment document has to be provided by the applicant&#8217;s Canadian employer.<\/p>\n<p>The processing times applications under this program can vary greatly. Some applications are processed within two weeks, while others may take months. This program consists of two separate streams. One for low and high skilled workers, and one for agricultural workers.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><u>Stream for Low and High Skilled Workers<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Many small and medium-sized businesses in Canada struggle to find workers to hire for their positions. This is due to shortages in the labour pool that can&#8217;t be fixed in the short run without the aid of foreign labour.<\/p>\n<p>Employers can employ workers from India via this TFWP stream for low and high skilled workers. However, this is valid only for positions that they are having difficulty filling with Canadian workers. Therefore, they must demonstrate that no Canadian residents could fill this role by conducting an LMIA.<\/p>\n<p>This LMIA may offer a pathway towards the permanent residence, as a successful LMIA can award workers between 50 and 600 CRS points. This point bonus gives Express Entry applicants an advantage when applying for permanent residency.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><u>Stream for Agricultural Workers<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Indian nationals who wish to pursue work in the agriculture industry in Canada and settle in the country can apply through the TFWP&#8217;s Agricultural Worker Stream. Alternatively, they can apply through the Agri-Food Immigration Pilot.<\/p>\n<p>These programs require one year of work experience in Canada&#8217;s agriculture industry as well as a full-time job offer from their employer. However, workers will need to apply for a work permit first to work in Canada and receive the required experience. This again requires a valid job offer as well as the completion of a labour market impact assessment.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Choose Elaar Immigration Consulting?<\/h2>\n<p>At <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/\">Elaar Immigration Consulting<\/a>, we have helped numerous Indian workers apply for Canadian work permits.
