Unfortunately, no matter how achievable the dream may seem, there may be a need for help from someone in another country to make it happen. This was the case for Gulbag Singh.<\/p>\n<p>Gulbag is from Punjab, <strong>India<\/strong> and has a dream of becoming a successful businessman to enable him to support his family members. His background education in the high-demand field of software development was a good start. He wanted to add an international education in business as well as some relevant experience to allow him to start his venture. Obviously, schools in his homeland couldn\u2019t deliver what he wanted, but he was able to find the help he needed.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4707\" style=\"width: 414px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4707\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4707\" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Gulbag in India\" width=\"404\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-100x100.jpeg 100w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-140x140.jpeg 140w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-500x500.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-350x350.jpeg 350w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-1000x1000.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1-800x800.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image1-1.jpeg 1077w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-4707\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Gulbag Singh in India<\/em><\/p><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe best thing about Canada is the environment and the infrastructure, which I couldn\u2019t find in India,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, due to the information he\u2019d seen while growing up and the childhood dreams he\u2019d formed, Gulbag thought he\u2019d go to the <strong>United States of America to study<\/strong>. He learned that there were certain aspects of studying and living in the USA that weren\u2019t beneficial to him, so he switched his focus to Canada.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoing to the USA was my first priority when I was beginning to think about where to do my studies,\u201d he says. \u201cI would love to visit the United States. Hopefully, in the near future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although he\u2019d changed his plans, it still wasn\u2019t as simple as making the decision to <strong>study in Canada<\/strong> and hop on a plane. As Gulbag explains, he was nervous about <strong>applying for a Canada student visa<\/strong> because he had heard from a number of people that there were quite a few student visa requests being turned down. At about that time, he spoke to his cousin, who lives in Surrey, BC.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe told me, \u2018I have a friend who is an excellent immigration consultant,\u2019\u201d Gulbag explains. \u201cThat\u2019s how I came to know about Keshav Sharma and Colossus Migration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Keshav was able to explain the process of applying for the Canada student visa to Gulbag, and he decided to engage the services of Colossus Migration.<\/p>\n<p>When faced with the IELTS (English language test), Gulbag didn\u2019t score as high as he\u2019d hoped, and Keshav explained that most schools require an extra semester that includes English study in such cases. They both wanted to avoid this as it would represent an additional semester of time and costs, and with Gulbag\u2019s goals of one day supporting his family, keeping costs down was necessary.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was important for me to explain how the immigration process works to Gulbag so that there would be no surprises for him,\u201d Keshav says. \u201cNot everyone who wants to study in Canada is successful in obtaining their student visa, but with a well-prepared application, the chances are much higher.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Keshav began by listening carefully to understand what Gulbag wanted from his studies in Canada and developed a shortlist of post-secondary institutions that were likely to admit Gulbag without the additional English semester requirement. The list created by Colossus Migration focused on the best options from schools carefully selected from all the possibilities throughout the country.<\/p>\n<p>Gulbag had already earned his Bachelor of Vocational Studies in Software Development from Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar, Punjab, so he was familiar with what was required in terms of studying at a post-secondary institution. He wanted to add the education and understanding of North American business practices and principles to grow his global knowledge base to give his future business a higher chance of success.<\/p>\n<p>He applied to three schools: NAIT (Northern Alberta Institute of Technology) in Edmonton, Alberta, Conestoga College in Kitchener, Ontario and Langara College in Vancouver, BC.<\/p>\n<p>While waiting for word of his admission, Gulbag and Keshav started putting together Gulbag\u2019s study visa application via email and phone. The process was quite an accomplishment given that the applicant was in Punjab, while the <strong>immigration consultant was in Vancouver, BC, Canada<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a tough time for me to wait because every day, I was just praying to God to bless me,\u201d Gulbag says. \u201cAnd he did.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Keshav contacted Gulbag to let him know the good news. He had been offered the option to study at Conestoga College without the additional semester requirement. Now the pair needed to focus on finalizing his study visa application. Everything fell into place perfectly despite the challenges of different countries and time zones. Gulbag was approved to study in Canada thanks to the experience and knowledge of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/\"><strong>Colossus Migration<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4702\" style=\"width: 404px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4702\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4702\" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Gulbag in Canada\" width=\"394\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-100x100.jpeg 100w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-140x140.jpeg 140w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-500x500.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-350x350.jpeg 350w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-1000x1000.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1-800x800.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image0-min-1.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-4702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Gulbag Singh in Canada<\/em><\/p><\/div>\n<p>\u201cLuckily, I got accepted here, to Conestoga College,\u201d Gulbag says. \u201cI came to Canada on the 13th of August, 2019.
