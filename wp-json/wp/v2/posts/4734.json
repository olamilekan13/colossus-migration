Here are the steps to be followed to create your online profile on the Express Entry system:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Take a Language Proficiency Test<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As part of the immigration process, all applicants need to prove their proficiency in at least one of Canada&#8217;s two official languages. Skilled immigration applicants must provide test results of a government-approved language test for their Express Entry profile.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Education Credentials Assessment\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Foreign nationals who completed their education outside of Canada should have their post-secondary education assessed from an organization designated by <strong>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)<\/strong> to ensure that the foreign education is equivalent to Canadian education. It is mandatory to obtain an educational credential assessment (ECA) for an individual if he is looking for Canada immigration under the <a href=\"http:\/\/elaarimmigration.ca\/federal-skilled-worker-program\/\"><strong>Federal Skilled Worker Program<\/strong><\/a>. The education requirement is not mandatory for the candidates applying under the <a href=\"http:\/\/elaarimmigration.ca\/federal-skilled-trades-program\/\"><strong>Federal Skilled Trade Program<\/strong><\/a> or the Canadian Experience Class.<\/p>\n<p>But if the candidates are looking to claim points for their foreign education in the Express Entry pool, it is pertinent for them to obtain their educational credential assessment (ECA) irrespective of the program under which they are applying. A successful evaluation can significantly increase the chances of a candidate&#8217;s accomplishment. Hence, it is suggested that all candidates under Express Entry programs should acquire a credential assessment.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4740\" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/group-of-students-holding-diplomas-copy-space-KHC3MDS-min-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"608\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/group-of-students-holding-diplomas-copy-space-KHC3MDS-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/group-of-students-holding-diplomas-copy-space-KHC3MDS-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/group-of-students-holding-diplomas-copy-space-KHC3MDS-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/group-of-students-holding-diplomas-copy-space-KHC3MDS-min-900x600.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Knowing your National Occupation Classification (NOC) code<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For successful Canada immigration through programs listed under Express Entry, one must be able to show his\/her work experience, and this work experience must meet the definition of an occupation that is included in the database of Canada&#8217;s National Occupation Classification.
