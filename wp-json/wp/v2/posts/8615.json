This is due to the following reasons:[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;1. Completing a Positive LMIA&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|font_size:24|text_align:left&#8221; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Cambo%3Aregular|font_style:400%20regular%3A400%3Anormal&#8221;][vc_column_text]Canadian employers who wish to hire foreigners to fill job vacancies must complete a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) and demonstrate that no Canadian citizens or permanent residents were available to fill the position.<\/p>\n<p>This LMIA process can be time-consuming, so employers generally prefer to hire local Canadian citizens or permanent residents. Some Canadian employers may be willing to go through the LMIA process if the foreign candidate possesses exceptional skills that make them a much better choice than local Canadian candidates.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;2.

This issue is more likely to occur for jobs in Human Resources departments that require interpersonal skills and a good understanding of how people conduct business in Canada.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;3.

Assurance the Employee Will Remain in Canada&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|font_size:24|text_align:left&#8221; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Cambo%3Aregular|font_style:400%20regular%3A400%3Anormal&#8221;][vc_column_text]Some Canadian employers may choose to hire Canadian citizens and permanent residents over foreigners due to the certainty that they will remain in Canada in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign workers who enter Canada with a temporary work permit are usually required to leave the country when their status expires. This means there is no guarantee they will be able to work for their employer in the long run. This uncertainty discourages many employers from hiring foreign workers.[\/vc_column_text][vc_text_separator title=&#8221;&#8221; color=&#8221;custom&#8221;][vc_column_text]<strong>Prospective foreign workers can overcome some of the challenges mentioned above by following these tips:<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;#1 Connect With Employers on LinkedIn&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Most Canadians apply for jobs online using websites such as <a href=\"https:\/\/ca.indeed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Indeed<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.ca\/Job\/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor<\/a>. Foreign workers can also submit their resumes for job applications on these sites. However, their application is less likely to be considered if hundreds of other candidates have applied to the same position.<\/p>\n<p>One possible workaround for this job hunt issue is to connect with the company\u2019s hiring manager directly on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>This requires you to research the company and learn which employee is in charge of making hiring decisions. You can then locate this hiring manager on LinkedIn, connect with them, and explain why you are a great candidate for the job opening directly.<\/p>\n<p>Some hiring managers are more receptive to this approach as it saves them the trouble of sifting through hundreds of resumes to choose a suitable candidate.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign workers who use this approach should ensure their resume is adapted to the Canadian style and that they pitch their skills to this hiring manager in a convincing manner.[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221;][vc_column_inner column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;][vc_video link=&#8221;https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ox_ohqsIMAM&#8221;][vc_column_text]Check out this useful video tutorial by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0xJOHl0Z241ckhIMWxqQ1dzM2wySnJiaXBmZ3xBQ3Jtc0trSS1mdy1ZNDlLc0lybF9PVXdHSUdXNUNlRnN4Q0VTXzVFakV4UERDMndDVWlYUVJyNlZla0xkdWU2eHFFT1BrWmg0emhhTlJzTmpZb0lkR0kzYWlRNFFWZklkWVJrQ2s3ekZTMGlHTFVPOFNkQXpEaw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fheather-austin%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Heather Austin<\/a> to create a strong LinkedIn profile and improve your odds of getting a job offer.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;#2 Adapt Your Resume to the Canadian Style&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]We mentioned adapting your resume to the Canadian style in the above tip.

You should avoid making your resume longer than this unless you have many decades of work experience and apply for a senior-level position.<\/p>\n<p>In most cases, it is helpful to keep a \u201cmaster\u201d resume that documents your entire work history. You can then create smaller versions of this resume that contain key work history details that are relevant to the job you are applying to.[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221;][vc_column_inner column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;][vc_video link=&#8221;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9-3z-zauGuE&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;#3 Use Provincial Job Bank Sites&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Foreign workers can also lookup jobs in their chosen province at the Government of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jobbank.gc.ca\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canada Job Bank website<\/a>. This job website allows you to filter jobs based on occupation type, location, employment conditions, language at work, period of employment, and salary.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you possess two years of work experience, speak English well, have a University degree, and are seeking a full-time sales position in Vancouver, you can navigate to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jobbank.gc.ca\/jobsearch\/advancedsearch?page=1&amp;sort=M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced search<\/a> page and type \u201cSales\u201d under the Job Title field.

However, job postings in such cities also attract Canadians from other parts of the country.<\/p>\n<p>A single job posting in Toronto is likely to receive hundreds of applications from prospective job seekers. This reduces your chances of ever receiving an interview for such a posting. The good news is that job postings outside major cities tend to be less competitive.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a job posting in Hamilton, Ontario, may receive a few dozen applicants. Job seekers who apply to positions in smaller cities have a much higher chance of receiving an interview. Hamilton is also only an hour\u2019s drive from Toronto. This means it is possible to live in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) while working in a smaller and more affordable city.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;#5 Apply for In-Demand Jobs&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]As mentioned earlier, it\u2019s not uncommon for job postings to receive dozens or even hundreds of applications from prospective job seekers. This is due to the supply of job seekers exceeding the demand for workers by a wide margin. Such scenarios are less likely to occur for \u201cin-demand\u201d jobs where there are a high number of positions to fill.<\/p>\n<p>You should note that these \u201cin-demand\u201d jobs vary from province to province. For example, there is a high demand for plumbers in British Columbia in 2022. Similarly, there is a high demand for transport truck drivers in Saskatchewan in 2022.<br \/>\nProspective foreign workers should look up which occupations are \u201cin-demand\u201d for their chosen provinces before applying for jobs.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;#6 Learn French&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Canada\u2019s two primary official languages are English and French. However, the vast majority of the country speaks English. The country\u2019s Quebec province is the only one where French is widely spoken.<\/p>\n<p>Many job postings in Quebec require applicants to be fluent in French. This discourages most foreign workers and Canadians from other provinces from applying to positions in Quebec. This also gives foreign workers who speak French advantage in applying for jobs in the province.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign workers who would like to boost their chances of getting a Canadian job offer should consider learning French if they have the time and resources. There are many free online resources such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.duolingo.com\/course\/fr\/en\/Learn-French\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Duolingo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondly.com\/learn-french-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mondly<\/a> to help you understand the language and become fluent in reading, speaking, and writing in French within one year.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;#7 Visit Canada on a Tourist Visa&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Prospective foreign job seekers who are having difficulty applying for jobs online may have better luck by visiting Canada on a visitor visa and applying for jobs in person.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have acquired your visitor visa, you can enter Canada and look for job opportunities in person. If you have already compiled a list of possible employers, you can visit their offices and attempt to speak with their hiring managers.<\/p>\n<p>Applying for jobs through this method gives you an advantage over other foreign applicants because you can demonstrate your language skills and understanding of the Canadian business environment in person.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign workers can also spend their visits attending job fairs across the country. There are many general job fairs as well as industry-specific job fairs held throughout the year.
