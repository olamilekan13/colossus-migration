Thousands of international students receive admission to Canadian colleges and universities each year. Such students must acquire a study visa before coming to Canada and studying at these institutes. However, many students may fail to obtain this visa.<\/p>\n<p>Study permit rejection rates have climbed in recent years, and it appears that they are becoming more strict these days.<\/p>\n<p>This guide will examine the various reasons for Canada <strong>study visa refusal<\/strong> and how you can avoid this scenario from happening to you.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;1.

Alternatively, they can show proof they have paid their tuition and housing costs.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;3.
