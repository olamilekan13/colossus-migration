Then she found Elaar Immigration.<\/p>\n<p>Deepanjali Sachdeva knows education better than most people. In her mid-40s, she had been working at a school in New Delhi, India, for about 25 years, and, in the last few years, she recognized she needed a change that would bring her growth and new opportunities. As an educator, she knew she wanted to earn her master\u2019s degree in education in a traditional classroom setting.<\/p>\n<p>This study and program structure weren\u2019t available in India, so she started looking abroad.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cCanada wasn\u2019t the only place in my mind,\u201d Deepanjali says. \u201cI started looking at the UK because it was closer to the flights. But I started to see that some students preferred to go to Canada rather than the UK.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, where she was looking to study didn&#8217;t seem to matter. She was told by those who worked in immigration in India that she was too old to qualify for a study visa.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cPerhaps if you immigrate to Canada, then apply to schools after you are a permanent resident,\u201d they told her.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou may not get admission to a high-level university, but maybe you could get admission into a college.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>They wanted her to lower her expectations. They told her that even if she somehow managed to gain admission to a good university, she would never get the necessary Canada study visa.<\/p>\n<p>But Deepanjali didn\u2019t want to relocate to another country. Her husband, daughter, friends, social system and current job were all in India. She also didn\u2019t want to attend college. This was about earning an advanced education suitable for an experienced educator.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cNot every program offers the same courses,\u201d she explains. She knew the types of schools she was interested in. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to get what you want, why spend all the money?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Feeling disheartened, one of her friends in New Delhi connected her with Keshav Sharma of Elaar Immigration.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI had so many questions for him. For so many years, I had tried to find people who could help me to study in Canada or the UK,\u201d she says. \u201cMy first question was, \u2018At my age, you think I could get admission to a good university?\u2019 and his answer was, \u2018Why not?\u2019. For so many years, I\u2019d been asking this question.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Keshav explains that every application is different, and while Deepanjali\u2019s was unique, he felt they could achieve her goals. Understanding the complexity involved is vital as there can be no cookie-cutter approach; every aspect of the case must be reviewed carefully.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt\u2019s important to know your goals in the immigration process,\u201d Keshav says. \u201cShe was clear about what she did and didn\u2019t want, making it easier to identify the best immigration paths to consider. The bottom line is if there is a strong enough reason and a genuine story, then one can study at any age.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The process was lengthy (about eight months), but together, they managed to get Deepanjali\u2019s paperwork. In the interim, she took the IELTS (English language proficiency) exam and considered different universities.<\/p>\n<p>When the exam results were in and were found to be satisfactory for a master\u2019s degree level of study in Canada, she applied to five universities in Canada from a shortlist created by Elaar Immigration from all available options \u2013 not just a few possibilities.<\/p>\n<p>Keshav and his team crafted the list based on institutions that were the best fit in terms of Deepanjali\u2019s education, background, work experience, the program offered, and immigration options if she\u2019d like to pursue this at a later stage.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a clue that the paperwork took that much time,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to get my transcripts done. Not an easy task in New Delhi. I got everything in place, and it took at least three months.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Keshav explains that the process can take a while for complex applications. It\u2019s important to be ready to gather the required information accurately.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cHe has been not just a positive person,\u201d she says of Keshav\u2019s guidance, \u201cHe has been actually like a mentor. He guided me well.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Her first acceptance came from the University of Prince Edward Island. While the family had suggested she might not like the winter climate, Deepanjali felt relief. Even if no other university accepted her, she had one of her five choices as an option. Now, it was a matter of securing a Canada student visa and seeing if her other choices came through.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cThen I got accepted from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tru.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thompson Rivers University<\/a> [TRU],\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone spoke so well of Kamloops. I was so happy. After living such a hectic life.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>She called Keshav, who was just as happy about her news as she was. They completed some more forms, and within two weeks, they submitted her Canada student visa application.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt was like someone who helps you, who walks you through everything,\u201d she says of Keshav. \u201cEvery little thing, he would call me, he would advise me.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4516 \" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/PHOTO-2020-04-14-21-03-35-604x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"723\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/PHOTO-2020-04-14-21-03-35.jpg 604w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/PHOTO-2020-04-14-21-03-35-177x300.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The next step was to go for biometrics with a visa facilitation service in New Delhi. Once complete and Elaar Immigration submitted her visa application online, it was a matter of waiting, again, to see if Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) would approve her request for the study visa. It would take about two weeks for the answer. This was the step that others had told her would be impossible, and she wasn\u2019t looking forward to waiting.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, as Deepanjali explains, there was some special kind of magic at play.<\/p>\n<p>Within just 12 hours of submission, Keshav called her to say he had received the request from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. Her Canada student visa had been approved, and it was time to submit her passport for stamping.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI was jumping and I was going crazy,\u201d she says. \u201cMy daughter and my husband, and I were all crying.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>With the student visa approved, they accepted the offer from TRU, and she was admitted as a student. Afterwards, she received an acceptance from Vancouver Island University, the third of her five chosen universities to accept her. She\u2019s happy she selected TRU.<\/p>\n<p>Keshav explains that while luck helps, being prepared, getting information together and working with a knowledgeable immigration consultant help make luck happen.<\/p>\n<p>Deepanjali arrived in Canada on August 5, 2019, and started her studies with TRU in September. She is now going into her third semester. She is on a sabbatical from her job in India, where she headed up the primary section of a school.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019ve fallen in love with this place,\u201d she says of Kamloops. \u201cOnly time will tell how much I miss my country and my people. I will definitely consider a plan to work here if there\u2019s a good job.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>She\u2019s enjoying her studies while finding them challenging. Her daughter has come to visit, and her husband will in the future. She credits Keshav and his team at Elaar Immigration (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\">Immigration Consultant Surrey<\/a>, Canada) for making her dream to study abroad possible when everyone else said it wasn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/canada-study-visa-after-long-gap\/\"><strong>Canada Study Visa After 5 to 25 Years Gap<\/strong><\/a>[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner equal_height=&#8221;yes&#8221;
