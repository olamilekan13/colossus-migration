Ineligibility Criteria<\/h2>\n<p>To be eligible for Express Entry, applicants must meet specific criteria established by the Canadian government. Ineligibility criteria can vary depending on the applicant&#8217;s situation but generally fall into several categories. Here is a closer look at the ineligibility criteria for Express Entry:<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Age<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Applicants must be <strong>at least 18 years old<\/strong> to be eligible for Express Entry. There is no maximum age limit, but applicants over the age of 45 may receive fewer points in the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) used to rank Express Entry candidates.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/immigration-to-canada-after-40\/\">How to Immigrate to Canada after the 40s?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Education<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>To be eligible for <strong>Express Entry<\/strong>, applicants must have completed a post-secondary education program of at least one year in duration. The program must have been completed at a recognized institution, either in Canada or abroad.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Work Experience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Applicants must have at least one year of skilled work experience in a National Occupational Classification <strong>NOC TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 occupations<\/strong>.

The <strong>amount of funds<\/strong> required varies depending on family size and is updated annually by the Canadian government.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Medical Inadmissibility<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Applicants may be deemed medically inadmissible if they have a medical condition that could pose a risk to public health or safety, or that could result in excessive demand on Canada&#8217;s healthcare system.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Criminal Inadmissibility<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Applicants may be deemed criminally inadmissible if they have been convicted of a crime, or if they have committed an act that would be considered a crime in Canada.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\n<h2 id=\"incomplete-application\">2. Failure to Provide Accurate or Complete Information<\/h2>\n<p>Failure to provide accurate or complete information on an Express Entry application can result in a rejection or even a ban from Canada&#8217;s immigration system. Here are some examples of incomplete or false information that can result in ineligibility:<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Providing False Information<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Applicants who provide <strong>false information on their application<\/strong>, such as fabricating work experience or education credentials, may be deemed inadmissible.

Failure to do so can result in ineligibility or even a ban from Canada&#8217;s immigration system.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Not Disclosing Family Members<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Applicants must disclose all family members, including those who are not accompanying them to Canada. This includes spouses, common-law partners, dependent children, parents, and siblings. Failure to do so can result in ineligibility or even a ban from Canada&#8217;s immigration system.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Not Disclosing Dependent Children<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Applicants must <strong>disclose all dependent children<\/strong>, including those who are not accompanying them to Canada.

Missing or Incomplete Documents<\/h2>\n<p>Missing or incomplete documents are a common reason for Express Entry application rejection.

The test results must be from an approved testing agency and must be current.

The reference letters must include details such as the applicant&#8217;s job title, job duties, and the duration of their employment.

The amount of settlement funds required depends on family size and is updated annually by the Canadian government. Failure to provide proof of settlement funds can result in ineligibility.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\n<h2 id=\"failure-to-meet-deadlines\">4. Failure to Meet Deadlines<\/h2>\n<p>Meeting deadlines is a crucial aspect of the Express Entry application process. Here are some examples of deadlines that applicants must meet and the consequences for failing to do so:<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Missing Application Deadlines<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Applicants must submit their Express Entry application within <strong>60 days of receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA)<\/strong> for permanent residence. Failure to submit the application within this deadline will result in the ITA expiring, and the applicant must re-enter the Express Entry pool.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #b10f2e;\">Not Responding to Requests for Additional Information or Documentation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>After submitting an application, applicants may receive requests for additional information or documentation from the immigration authorities. These requests usually have a deadline, and failing to respond or provide the requested information within the given timeframe can result in a rejection of the application.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\n<h2 id=\"proof-of-relationship\">5. Inadequate Proof of Relationship<\/h2>\n<p>Applicants must provide adequate proof of relationship with family members listed in the application, such as marriage certificates, birth certificates, or adoption papers.
