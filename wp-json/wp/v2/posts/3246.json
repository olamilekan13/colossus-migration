Currently, about thirty countries including Canada, Mexico and Brazil automatically grant birthright citizenship. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have demanded that at least one of the parents must be a citizen or permanent resident at the time of the child\u2019s birth in order for the child to receive birthright citizenship; thereby these countries have tightened their laws. Canada also faces a similar problem. In Richmond, BC, which has a large Chinese-resident community, one-fifth of the babies born at the Richmond Hospital are born to mothers who do not permanently live in Canada. Last summer, the Canadian opposition approved a non-binding motion calling for the abolition of unconditional birthright citizenship. However, the motion was useless. The government responded that It is completely legal for foreigners to have children in Canada because they want to give their children Canadian citizenship. However, after the elections, the unconditional birthright citizenship may be reconsidered, depending on the results of the election.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The United States is considering abolishing birthright citizenship.
