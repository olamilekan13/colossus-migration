Each program varies based on its requirements. Some programs help immigrants settle in a particular province, while others offer permanent residence based on work experience or investment.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most popular programs for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/canada-immigration\/\"><strong>Canada immigration<\/strong><\/a> is the <a href=\"http:\/\/elaarimmigration.ca\/federal-skilled-worker-program\/\"><strong>Federal Skilled Worker Program<\/strong><\/a>. This guide will discuss the requirements for this program and the ways applicants can use it to obtain permanent resident status in Canada.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Federal Skilled Worker Program?<\/h3>\n<p>The Federal Skilled Worker Program was initially launched in 1967 and remained the most popular immigration program for prospective immigrants. This program is one of the three programs within <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/express-entry\/\"><strong>Canada&#8217;s Express Entry system<\/strong><\/a> and offers a way to achieve permanent resident status based on experience and skills.<\/p>\n<p>This program is best suited for individuals from highly skilled occupations classified under the National Occupation Code (NOC).<\/p>\n<h3>Federal Skilled Worker Program Requirements<\/h3>\n<p>The Federal Skilled Worker Program uses six selection factors to assess applicants. Each factor provides a certain number of points. Applicants will need 67 out of 100 points to qualify for the Federal Skilled Worker Program.<\/p>\n<p>The selection factors are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language Skills<\/li>\n<li>Education<\/li>\n<li>Work experience<\/li>\n<li>Age<\/li>\n<li>Job Offer<\/li>\n<li>Adaptability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go through each factor and determine how you can maximize your points.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Language Skills<\/h3>\n<p>Applicants must possess good English or French language skills to receive an adequate number of points in their Federal Skilled Worker Program application. IRCC requires applicants to prove their language skills by taking an approved language test. For English, this test is the Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB) test. Applicants who are more fluent in French than English can take the Niveaux de comp\u00e9tence linguistique canadiens (NCLC). Each of these tests is subdivided into four distinct sections:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing<\/li>\n<li>Reading<\/li>\n<li>Listening<\/li>\n<li>Speaking<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Applicants&#8217; scores in each section will determine which benchmark they fall into according to the following table.<\/p>\n<table class=\"table-border\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th><\/th>\n<th><strong>Speaking<\/strong><\/th>\n<th><strong>Listening<\/strong><\/th>\n<th><strong>Reading<\/strong><\/th>\n<th><strong>Writing<\/strong><\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>CLB Level 9 or higher<\/strong><\/td>\n<td>6<\/td>\n<td>6<\/td>\n<td>6<\/td>\n<td>6<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>CLB Level 8<\/strong><\/td>\n<td>5<\/td>\n<td>5<\/td>\n<td>5<\/td>\n<td>5<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>CLB Level 7<\/strong><\/td>\n<td>4<\/td>\n<td>4<\/td>\n<td>4<\/td>\n<td>4<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Lower than CLB level 7<\/strong><\/td>\n<td>Does not qualify<\/td>\n<td>Does not qualify<\/td>\n<td>Does not qualify<\/td>\n<td>Does not qualify<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>If English or French is your first language, you will need to score benchmark CLB Level 7 or higher to receive points. It is possible to get a score of up to 24 points on your language test. Applicants can also score up to an additional 4 points if their second language qualifies as CLB Level 5 or higher.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Education<\/h3>\n<p>The Federal Skilled Worker favours applicants with secondary or post-secondary education. This requires:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A certification, degree or diploma from a secondary or post-secondary education institution in Canada.<\/li>\n<li>Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) issued by a foreign secondary or post-secondary education institution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The number of points from each type of qualification is shown below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doctorate degree, Ph.D. or Professional Degree: 23 to 25 points<\/li>\n<li>Master&#8217;s Degree: 23 points<\/li>\n<li>Bachelor&#8217;s Degree: 19 to 23 points<\/li>\n<li>Post-secondary certificate or Diploma: 15 to 21 points<\/li>\n<li>Educational Certificates: 15 to 23 points<\/li>\n<li>High School Diploma or Certificate: 5 points<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Applicants can score up to 25 points in this category if they possess the right education.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Work Experience<\/h3>\n<p>Applicants can also use their work experience to earn points. Those who have worked full-time jobs (defined as 30 hours per week) in Canada or abroad can earn points if the job:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Belonged to the NOC skill level 0, A, or B<\/li>\n<li>Was performed while studying.<\/li>\n<li>Was performed while also self-employed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The points granted for work experience are as follows:<\/p>\n<table class=\"table-border\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Experience<\/strong><\/th>\n<th><strong>Points<\/strong><\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 year<\/td>\n<td>9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 to 3 years<\/td>\n<td>11<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 to 5 years<\/td>\n<td>13<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 or more years<\/td>\n<td>15<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>4.
