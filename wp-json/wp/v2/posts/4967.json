Canada has the following free trade agreements with other partner countries:<\/p>\n<p>North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and now the new United States Mexico Canada (USMCA) Trade Agreement<\/p>\n<p>Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)<\/p>\n<p>Peru-Canada Free Trade Agreement<\/p>\n<p>Chile-Canada Free Trade Agreement<\/p>\n<p>Korea-Canada Free Trade Agreement and<\/p>\n<p>Colombia-Canada Free Trade Agreement<\/p>\n<p><strong>CANADIAN INTERESTS [R205 (a)] \u2013 <\/strong>Under this provision, intra-company transferees are granted LMIA exempt work permits under exemption code C12 as they provide significant <strong>economic benefit to Canada<\/strong> through the transfer of their expertise to Canadian businesses. This applies to foreign nationals from any country, including\u00a0General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).<\/p>\n<p>Companies that bring international employees to Canada under Intra-Company Transferee are exempted from obtaining a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). It is to make the process simpler, faster, and economical than the LMIA route. The most significant advantage for Intra-Company Transferees is that the individual has a strong chance of being a permanent resident of Canada. If an individual obtains <strong>permanent residency in Canada<\/strong>, the individual can live and <strong>work in Canada permanently<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign investment and a qualified workforce are vital for a growing economy. Thus, multi-national businesses are encouraged to <strong>invest in Canada<\/strong>. The Canadian government also grants temporary work for eligible key employees from other countries. These types of arrangements help the growth of foreign businesses in Canada. It leads to the contribution by MNCs to Canada&#8217;s economy and higher job opportunities in the nation.
