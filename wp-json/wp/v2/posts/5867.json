This immigration pathway offers a permanent residency option to business owners who are looking to open a new business in BC or to those looking to expand an existing operation into the province.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition to these established streams, BC PNP has also introduced and extended a 2017 <strong>Tech Pilot program<\/strong> that allows for fast-tracked immigration for individuals with in-demand skills in the technology sector and a <strong>Regional Pilot program<\/strong> entrepreneurial immigration to regional communities.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What Streams Are Receiving the Highest Number of Nominations?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In 2019 BC welcomed over 6,550 new immigrants to the province.

While some streams are aligned with the broader <strong>Canadian Express Entry system<\/strong>, others may require a separate registration under the BC SIRS. For example, candidates desiring accelerated entry, who met the minimum requirement of one of the federal Express Entry Program, must first create an online profile within the <strong>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada\u2019s (IRCC) Express Entry<\/strong> system before registering online with BC PNP.<\/p>\n<p>Other candidates, particularly those who may not meet all the minimum requirements under an <strong>Express Entry Program<\/strong>, may still be eligible under a BC PNP pathway. These candidates may submit a paper application directly through the SI stream. Processing times tend to be longer than with Express Entry.<\/p>\n<p>If you need help choosing the most appropriate <strong>BC PNP pathway<\/strong>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/\"><strong>Elaar Immigration<\/strong><\/a> can help.
