OnCampus<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On campus jobs are a brilliant opportunity for you to expand your academic experience in Canada. It allows you to work closely with your professors, fellow students, and other faculty members on the campus. Plus, you feel like a part of the campus instead of a stranger when you work there.<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-3203 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/College-Student2.jpg\" alt=\"work opportunities in Canada \" width=\"364\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/College-Student2.jpg 364w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/College-Student2-300x185.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What kind of jobs can you get on the campus? The primary job openings connect your role as a student with the activities happening on campus. It includes becoming a tour guide, working at the helpdesk or assisting the admin department.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What\u2019s more? Many students with above average grades can try their luck as a teaching assistant. Additionally, if you are a science student then you can work as a research\/lab assistant.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the biggest advantages of working on campus is the flexible hours. Students can easily walk to and fro from classes to their workstation during the day without any worry. Besides this, you cut down on your transport charges and save time when you work inside the campus.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>2. OffCampus<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3205 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/College-Students-3.png\" alt=\"work opportunities in Canada \" width=\"426\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/College-Students-3.png 426w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/College-Students-3-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are you looking for more opportunities?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then working outside the campus will be a better option.The student permit allows you to get a part time job during the semester. However, you may opt for a full-time job once your semester ends.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The off campus work gives you a chance to branch out and experience the real world. In most cases, students select jobs related to retail or food service. That\u2019s because these work opportunities are easy to juggle with their studies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, you may apply for career-specific jobs between your breaks. In that way, you\u2019ll be prepared to choose the right career path after graduation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>3. Co-Op Student<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is getting an internship part of your coursework?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many study programs make it mandatory for their students to get an internship or work placement gig before they graduate. The internship program typically counts for 50% or less of their grades. International students who\u2019re enrolled in such programs are required to register for a Co-Op\/Internship work permit to work in this situation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This permit is only applicable to international students who have:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 A valid study permit.<br \/>\n\u2022 Need a designated amount of work hours to complete their course.<br \/>\n\u2022 An official letter that confirms that all the students mustfinish their work placements before finals\/graduation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The process to apply for this permit is pretty straightforward. You simply have to present the proper documents and register for the work permit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>4. Post Graduate Work Permit (PGWP)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What happens after graduation?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">International students face two choices after they graduate. They can either stay back in Canada to start their professional career here. Or they can go back to their country once their study <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">permit<\/span> expires. Many people opt for the PGWP because it increases their chance to get permanent residency in Canada.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What\u2019s PGWP? It\u2019s a type of open work permit that allows you to work full time anywhere in Canada. The work permit is valid for 1-3 <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">years<\/span><\/strong> depending on the duration of your study program. The applicants must have a Canadian degree and set of skills required for the job.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike, most work permits, this one doesn\u2019t require a letter of appointment or statement from a Canadian employer. You\u2019re basically allowed to find your career path without restrictions when you have this work permit at hand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a result, PGWP paves the way to a financially secure and career-driven future in Canada.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Let\u2019s Sum It Up&#8230;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a nutshell, international students in Canada get many privileges when they come to study here.
