This is possible through the <strong>Canadian Spouse Visa<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals who intend to use this program to bring their spouse, common-law partner, or conjugal partner to Canada along with their dependents must show proof that their relationship is genuine. This guide will examine the different methods of proof that Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) accepts for this program.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Three types of relationships in the Canadian Spouse Visa&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]The Canadian family sponsorship program allows Canadian permanent residents and citizens to sponsor family members, spouses, or other kinds of partners.

These are summarized below.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;1. Marriage Certificate&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]A <strong>marriage certificate<\/strong> is a legally issued and recognized document that demonstrates a marriage between two individuals. This is the most important form of proof for Canadian citizens and permanent residents who wish to sponsor a spouse.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals who are in a <strong>common-law<\/strong> or <strong>conjugal partnership<\/strong> are not legally married, so they must show other forms of proof instead, like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>reference letters from friends or family that can attest to your relationship<\/li>\n<li>personal statements of when, where, how you met, and difficulties you have faced in trying to be together.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;2. Joint Bank Accounts&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]If the Canadian citizen or permanent resident and their partner have <strong>a joint bank account<\/strong> in Canada, they must prove that the account shows the same address. This is useful for spouses and common-law partners who must demonstrate they live together.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;3. Joint Leases&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]If the Canadian citizen or permanent resident and their partner share ownership of a property or have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/j\/joint-tenancy.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>a joint lease<\/strong><\/a>, they must present proof of this with the sponsorship application.

Joint Utility Bills&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Spouses or partners residing together can present joint utility bills such as electricity bills, water bills, or bills as proof.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;5. Relationships Photos&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Canadian citizens or permanent residents can offer supporting proof of their relationship with their spouse or partner with photos showing them together. Couples should ideally include <strong>a minimum of twenty photos<\/strong> showing their relationship from the time they met up till the present day.<\/p>\n<p>Couples who are married should include their <strong>wedding photos<\/strong> with their application. Those who are in common-law or conjugal partnerships and do not possess wedding photos can show photos of themselves with friends and family. This serves to demonstrate that the couple\u2019s friends and family are aware they are in a relationship.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;6. Relationship Narrative&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]A relationship narrative is an important document that applicants should include with their application. This document describes <strong>the couple\u2019s relationship story<\/strong> from the time they met up till the present day. Each person should write the narrative from their perspective, as this will help convince the visa officer that the relationship is genuine.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Need help with Canadian spouse visa?&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Prospective Canadian permanent residents and citizens who wish to sponsor their spouse, common-law partner, or conjugal partner to come to Canada should <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/contact-us\/\">get in touch with us<\/a>.
