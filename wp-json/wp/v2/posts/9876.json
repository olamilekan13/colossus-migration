If a student fails to demonstrate that their primary reason for entering Canada is to study, they will be rejected.<\/p>\n<p>The official reason for this rejection will resemble the following statement:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>I am not satisfied that you will leave Canada at the end of your stay, as stipulated in subsection 216(1) of the IRPR, based on the purpose of your visit.<\/strong>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can make a more convincing case by attaching your College or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kluniversity.in\/physics\/images\/pdf\/add.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">University acceptance letter<\/a> with your application.<\/p>\n<p>This shows that you have admission into a Canadian educational institution and that you could pursue an educational program in the country. However, this is already a requirement for study permit applicants.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A better solution is to include a study plan in the <a href=\"https:\/\/elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/canada-study-permit-refusal-reasons\/#cover\">cover letter<\/a> you intend to submit with your application.<\/p>\n<p>In this study plan, you should mention your passion for studying the subject you will be taking courses in once you reach Canada.<\/p>\n<p>You can also mention that you will obtain a degree, diploma, or certificate after completing this program and that it will help you in your future career.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;#2 Limited Employment Prospects in the Home Country&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1656595805967{padding-top: 40px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]<strong>&#8221; I am not satisfied that you will leave Canada at the end of your stay, as stipulated in subsection 216(1) of the IRPR, based on the limited employment prospects in your country of residence.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>IRCC aims to attract the best and brightest minds to pursue higher education in Canada.

This is a common strategy for international students. However, the key point of this is to demonstrate that they intend to return home.<\/p>\n<p>Applicants with limited employment prospects in their home country may use their study permit to enter Canada and stay on and work illegally after their student status expires.<\/p>\n<p>IRCC attempts to discourage this practice by rejecting applicants with limited employment prospects in their home country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can demonstrate that you have good employment prospects in your home country by including a career progression in your <a href=\"https:\/\/elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/canada-study-permit-refusal-reasons\/#cover\">cover letter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This career progression should include information about past jobs you have held in your current country and how obtaining a degree, diploma, or certificate in Canada will enable you to obtain higher-skilled jobs in your chosen field.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;#3 Unstable Current Employment Situation&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1656595829476{padding-top: 40px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]<strong>&#8220;I am not satisfied that you will leave Canada at the end of your stay, as stipulated in subsection 216(1) of the IRPR, based on your current employment situation.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>IRCC may also reject people with an unstable employment situation in their home country. This refusal reason is similar to the one listed above. However, it applies to people who already have jobs in their home country.<\/p>\n<p>If the visa officer has reason to believe the company you are currently working for is going to shut down, lay off its employees, or fire you, they will reject your study permit application.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can work around this issue by providing information on your company in the <a href=\"https:\/\/elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/canada-study-permit-refusal-reasons\/#cover\">cover letter<\/a>, especially with regard to how it is a successful business.

This can occur if you have mentioned that you intend to settle in Canada after completing your studies.<\/p>\n<p>You should remember to avoid showing dual intent because the IRCC issues study permits for people who intend to leave Canada after finishing their studies.<\/p>\n<p>Stating you plan to work and settle in the country afterward offers the impression you are using the study permit as a way to get into Canada and avoid returning to your home country.<\/p>\n<p>You can avoid giving Canadian visa officers this impression by stating that you intend to go back to your family and work in your home country as soon as you are done with your studies.<\/p>\n<p>You should state this even if you believe you will be eligible for a Post-Graduation Work Permit after completing your program in Canada.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;#11 Poorly Structured Cover Letter&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1656596477613{padding-top: 40px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]Your cover letter plays a vital role in explaining your reasons for coming to Canada and demonstrating that you intend to return to your home country once your studies are done.
