The <em>only<\/em> problem is that most immigrants are unaware of these options. That\u2019s why they end up applying for the most frequently used immigration programs. The ones they have heard about or seen other people applying to in their imminent social circle.<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the catch! Your selected immigration program might not be the <em>right<\/em> fit for you. It may so happen that you chose the wrong path even though a more preferable solution existed.

Simplified Solutions<\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_3163\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3163\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3163 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Pasted-into-Why-Should-You-Hire-a-Regulated-Canadian-Immigration-Consultant-1.png\" alt=\"Canadian immigration consultants\" width=\"311\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Pasted-into-Why-Should-You-Hire-a-Regulated-Canadian-Immigration-Consultant-1.png 311w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Pasted-into-Why-Should-You-Hire-a-Regulated-Canadian-Immigration-Consultant-1-300x194.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3163\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Get the best advice on Canadian immigration from consultants.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><em>Do you think you\u2019ve got everything you need for your Canadian immigration?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Most immigrants make the mistake of looking things up online and then implementing the misguided information. The fact of the matter is that online databases can\u2019t possibly provide applicants with the full picture. \u00a0Additionally, no amount of \u2018how to immigrate to Canada\u2019 guides can thoroughly cover all the bases.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, even official government websites don\u2019t share all the legal regulations, clauses or rules on one platform. You\u2019re required to get the proper information through thorough research on multiple platforms.<\/p>\n<p><em>So what should you do?<\/em>You need to contact the <em>right<\/em> sources and dig up more research if you want to go through the complete process. This means that you need to retrieve the information through proper channels. Plus, even when you do access all the information, it isn\u2019t necessary that you\u2019ll understand it. We\u2019ve seen countless cases where immigrants have made devastating mistakes due to misinterpretation.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds confusing, doesn\u2019t it? This is <em>exactly<\/em> why you\u2019re better off with an immigration consultant at your side. They help you navigate through the nitty-gritty details of paperwork and application legalities. They also ensure that you understand each and every step of the immigration process.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Authorized Channels<\/h2>\n<p>Many immigrants are intimidated by the prospect of representing themselves in front of the Canadian government. In reality, they are unlikely to this alone. That\u2019s because an average immigrant isn\u2019t qualified enough to tackle the legal process. Thus, they have to hire a consultant by default.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, if you do this after your visa process has met a roadblock then you\u2019re bound to pay a hefty price. Moreover, you need to start briefing them on your whole immigration profile\/process in a very short time. Not only does this prove to be an inconvenience for both of you. But it also prevents you from receiving proper customized solutions. That\u2019s because the lack of time may cause consultants to act hastily. So your delayed decision causes you to lose out on money, time and precision.<\/p>\n<h3><em>Bonus Factor:<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t <em>just<\/em> get official representation for the immigration department when you hire a licensed consultant. It is believed that immigration consultants are a great medium to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply at notable universities\/schools in Canada<\/li>\n<li>Get in touch with recruiters and talent hunters<\/li>\n<li>Coordinate with the main immigration office<\/li>\n<li>Seek information and queries about the legal aspects of the paperwork<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All in all, they ensure that everything is done via proper channels.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Staying on Top of the Process<\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_3164\" style=\"width: 136px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3164\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3164 \" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Pasted-into-Why-Should-You-Hire-a-Regulated-Canadian-Immigration-Consultant-2.png\" alt=\"Role of Canadian immigration consultants\" width=\"126\" height=\"191\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keep tabs on the immigration process with the right kind of assistance.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Deadlines are the driving force for all your immigration milestones. From sending in the application forms to handing over your supplementary documents\u2015there are several dates to remember here. Plus, there is a lot of paperwork that\u2018s required for you to become an eligible candidate for immigration. You\u2019re bound to mess up or miss out on details when you\u2019re working alone. This is especially true for people who\u2019ve never lived abroad.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, getting a regulated consultant seems like a strategic move. That\u2019s because their professional assistance will help you to:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Stay on top of all your deadlines without a hitch<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Cover all the minute details in the paperwork (e.g. signatures, spellings and supplementary documentation)<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Meet the requirements and fulfill all the necessary steps needed for each immigration program<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Moreover, there have been times where the rules or format of the application program has been modified.

The consultants prove to be an effective way to prevent any misstep.<\/p>\n<p>In short, immigration consultants operate as a voice of wisdom during your immigration process. They ensure that you don\u2019t miss out any important stuff or sign up to something that\u2019ll tarnish your reputation in front of the officials.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Choose Us?<\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_3165\" style=\"width: 327px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3165\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3165 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Pasted-into-Why-Should-You-Hire-a-Regulated-Canadian-Immigration-Consultant-3.png\" alt=\"benefits of Canadian immigration consultants\" width=\"317\" height=\"209\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Pasted-into-Why-Should-You-Hire-a-Regulated-Canadian-Immigration-Consultant-3.png 317w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Pasted-into-Why-Should-You-Hire-a-Regulated-Canadian-Immigration-Consultant-3-300x198.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3165\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Get your hands on a Canadian passport by opting for a professional consultant.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/\">Colossus Migration<\/a> is one of the leading immigration consultancy firm for immigration to Canada.\u00a0 They tick all the boxes when it comes to finding effective solutions for your immigration.\u00a0 They are diligent, meticulous and licensed practitioners.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, you can look up our principal consultant Keshav Sharma on the ICCRC directory to verify our claims.
