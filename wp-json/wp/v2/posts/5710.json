Due to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/canada-continues-to-welcome-international-students-during-covid-19\/\"><strong>Covid-19 pandemic<\/strong><\/a>, the tests were put on hold to ensure proper identification of candidates undergoing the test. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On 26th November 2020, the IRCC launched an online platform for citizenship tests. IRCC first offered it to a small group of around 5000 individuals whose appointment was fixed before the Covid-19 pandemic. IRCC will test the online platform for citizenship tests for the next couple of months and invite more individuals to use it. IRCC will do it at the start of 2021 once the online platforms&#8217; performance proves to be reliable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before the pandemic, the individuals who had applied for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/canada-immigration\/\"><strong>Canada immigration<\/strong><\/a> were stuck as the immigration pathway to gain Canada PR was blocked. IRCC says it will slowly and steadily resume all the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/\"><strong>Canada immigration services<\/strong><\/a>, which were shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before starting the citizenship test, candidates will be approached to confirm their identity by sharing personal details. They should snap a picture of themselves and their ID record with a webcam before the test starts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The system will take photographs of candidates during the test \u2014 a cycle that has been utilized to guarantee the trustworthiness of different tests that moved online because of the pandemic, for example, law or graduate school admission tests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The citizenship candidates will have to give the test in 21 days according to their convenience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Is the online test format the same as the in-person test? Yes! Candidates have to answer 20 questions in 30 minutes. As per the IRCC\u2019s guidelines, candidates need not call the department to be informed via email by their representatives. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is set to resume the citizenship tests online after eight months.
