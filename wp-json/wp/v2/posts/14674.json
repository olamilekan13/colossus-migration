You can conveniently check your eligibility finding your NOC TEER Code <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/find-national-occupation-code.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The NOC TEER Code will help you determine if you meet the basic\u00a0 skilled worker requirements. After that you must check your Comprehensive Ranking Score using our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/crs-score-calculator\/\"><strong>CRS Score Calculator<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>An increase in your CRS score gives you a higher chance of receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA). You can improve your CRS score by gaining higher education, improving language skills, or gaining Canadian work experience.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Acquiring Your Credentials and Documents<\/h3>\n<p>Before you apply for immigration, make sure you have all the relevant documents that show your education and experience to your potential employer. Documents you may need include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Degree, certifications, and transcripts from college and\/or university showing your qualifications,<\/li>\n<li>Letter of reference and experience from your employer as evidence of your work experience and<\/li>\n<li>Letters from professional or regulatory bodies showing your association with your industry in your homeland.<\/li>\n<li>Passport or travel documents<\/li>\n<li>Language test results (IELTS, CELPIP, or TEF)<\/li>\n<li>Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) report if you studied outside of Canada<\/li>\n<li>Proof of work experience<\/li>\n<li>Medical examination and police clearance certificates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Step 3: Plan Your Entry<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have your documents and credentials, you can plan your entry into Canada. You can create your <strong>Express Entry profile<\/strong>, or if you have a job offer, you can also apply for a work permit.<\/p>\n<p>To <strong>apply for a work permit<\/strong>, you will need additional documents, including a job offer letter and proof of financial support.<\/p>\n<p>You can also apply for immigration through <strong>Tech PNP<\/strong> and targeted <strong>Express Entry<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Receiving an Invitation and Applying for Permanent Residence<\/h3>\n<p>The last step is to apply for permanent residence in Canada. Given that several immigration programs allow you to apply for a <strong>Canada PR as a software engineer<\/strong>, it\u2019s critical to know the requirements of each application process so you can get the desired outcome.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\n<h2>Top Cities in Canada for Tech Jobs<\/h2>\n<p>Canada&#8217;s tech industry is primarily centralized in a few key cities including Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and Ottawa.
