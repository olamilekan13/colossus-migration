One should use the same strategy to choose their colleges. Apart from looking at the courses, rankings and reputation\u2013you need to look at the social diaspora. That\u2019s because studying abroad becomes a hassle if you select a country that\u2019s completely foreign to you.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is known for its courteous nature and accepting attitude. Latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2019\/03\/new-immigrants-made-up-61-of-canadas-population-growth-in-2018-0312086.html#gs.dagu5v\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports<\/a> reveal that almost 61% of the Canadian population consists of immigrants. That means that not <em>only<\/em> will this multicultural society provide you with a new experience. But you\u2019ll easily find people from your diaspora here too. (This comes in handy when you\u2019re craving food from back home.)<\/p>\n<h2>2.\u00a0 Budget-Friendly Living<\/h2>\n<p>Admit it. The biggest hurdle in your plans to study abroad isn\u2019t the visa. It\u2019s the expenses!<\/p>\n<p>Many parents put their foot down in matters of studying abroad due to it being a very costly experience. They are also uncertain about how their child will survive once they land there.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you\u2019d think that like the best colleges in America or the UK, Canadian schools will come with a hefty school fee too. But surprisingly, the academic fee structure of Canada is pretty economical. Additionally, there are plenty of scholarship programs available to international students who wish to apply here.<\/p>\n<p>All things considered, studying in Canada proves to be a more attainable educational goal compared to anywhere else in the world. International students have also found it a lot easier to live here. The reason lies in the fact that rental rates and other facilities are cheaper than most college groves in the world.<\/p>\n<h2>3.\u00a0 World Class Education<\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_3144\" style=\"width: 494px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3144\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3144 \" title=\"University\" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Pasted-into-1-1.png\" alt=\"benefits of studying in Canada\" width=\"484\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Pasted-into-1-1.png 593w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Pasted-into-1-1-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3144\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The world\u2019s biggest classrooms are waiting for you.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><em>What about the education system?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Admittedly, many other countries might have a multicultural society and affordable education system.<\/p>\n<p>But the question is: are they credible enough to secure your future?<\/p>\n<p>The University of Toronto, McGill University and the University of British Columbia are some of the options.<\/p>\n<p>They all enjoy exceptional rankings in the educational world.

There are various reasons why this is a practical option. For starters, the eligibility for a student visa has lesser restrictions than one for a work permit or permanent residency program. You\u2019ll also get to prepare for career opportunities on Canadian grounds when you study here.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest bonus is the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). This particular permit authorizes you to get work as soon as you complete your post-secondary education.<\/p>\n<p>But it is important to note that PGWP is only available to international students who study in government approved colleges. So be selective and strategic when you\u2019re applying to study in Canada. You don\u2019t want the wrong choice to mess up your prospects of living here.<\/p>\n<p>The permit gives you a chance to work in Canada for a set duration depending on your program. Then you require a minimum one year of work experience to qualify for the Canadian Experience Class program from the Express Entry system. You may also become eligible for other immigration programs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/provincial-nominee-program\/\">Provincial Nominee Program<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/federal-skilled-worker-program\/\">Federal Skilled Worker Program<\/a> and many other programs. The options are endless here and each offers lots of benefits.<\/p>\n<p>After that, once your application and permanent residency process starts, you\u2019ll become a permanent resident of Canada in no time.<\/p>\n<h2>Let\u2019s Sum It Up\u2026<\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_3145\" style=\"width: 468px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3145\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3145 \" title=\"Study Group\" src=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Pasted-into-1-2.png\" alt=\"benefits of studying in Canada\" width=\"458\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Pasted-into-1-2.png 623w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Pasted-into-1-2-300x202.png 300w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Pasted-into-1-2-600x403.png 600w, https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Pasted-into-1-2-400x269.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3145\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Study in Canada to kick-start your career plans.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Honestly speaking, mere words can\u2019t sum up the kind of amazing experiences you\u2019ll have in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>Studying in Canada is economical, practical and educational. \u00a0When you weigh it all in, studying in Canada proves to be less stressful for both you and your parents.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to that, not only do you graduate with lots of credentials, but you also step closer to securing permanent residency in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>So studying in Canada also proves to be the simplest way to move to Canada.<\/p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for?
