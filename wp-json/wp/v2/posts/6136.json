Program applicants should be registered in one of the province\u2019s existing immigration streams and possess a job offer from a qualifying occupation to be eligible for this program. Securing a job offer for this program can be challenging for some applicants.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some fantastic strategies to help you get a job offer for the B.C. tech pilot program.<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;1. Apply on job sites&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]The most straightforward approach to finding a job in British Columbia is through job sites. Websites such as <a href=\"https:\/\/ca.indeed.com\/jobs-in-British-Columbia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Indeed<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.monster.ca\/jobs\/l-british-columbia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monster<\/a> are great for discovering new job postings in different industries. You can look up jobs in engineering or I.T., as these may fall under the list of approved occupations for the British Columbia Tech Pilot program.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign nationals that apply for such jobs should have a good resume prepared beforehand. Such resumes are vital, as they will be competing against Canadian citizens and residents for these jobs. Such applicants may get a leg-up on others by possessing more experience in their field.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/british-columbia-provincial-nominee-program\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is BC PNP Skills Immigration program right for you?<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;2. Use LinkedIn&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Many British Columbia job listings are also posted on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/jobs-in-british-columbia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn<\/a>. You can use this platform to find new job listings that qualify under the approved B.C. Tech Pilot program occupations. However, another advantage of using LinkedIn is that it allows you to connect with people at different companies.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can look up senior employees at companies you are interested in working at and offer to connect with them. You can then discuss any potential job openings at the company and ask them to forward your resume to their H.R. department. This approach is useful as it allows you to discover job openings that may not be listed publicly.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;3. Check your network&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]If you know individuals that are already living and working in B.C., you can ask them about job opportunities in the province. This approach is best for people that maintain a large network in the province.<\/p>\n<p>B.C. residents can connect you with potential employers or business owners that may require employees with your specific skill set. This can help you acquire a job relatively easily and bypass the process of sending your resume through the company\u2019s job portal.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;4. Use an Employment Agency&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Many countries have employment agencies that specialize in helping clients secure jobs abroad. If you can find one of these employment agencies, they may be able to help you find a qualifying job in B.C.<\/p>\n<p>If you intend to use this approach, you should ensure the agency understands the requirements that allow you to qualify for the B.C. Tech Pilot program. This will help them narrow their search criteria and ensure that it is eligible under the program.<\/p>\n<p>Ready to start your Tech Pilot application?

Get a Work Permit&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]This method doesn\u2019t land you a job offer directly, but it can certainly help you. The truth is that few B.C. employers are prepared to give job offers to individuals without work permits. If you are currently residing in British Columbia, getting a work permit can significantly improve your chances of securing a job in the province.<\/p>\n<p>You should note that it can be challenging to apply for a work permit without first securing a job offer. However, there are many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cic.gc.ca\/english\/helpcentre\/answer.asp?qnum=177&amp;top=17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">situations<\/a> where you may be eligible for an open work permit without already possessing a job offer.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Additional Tips&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securing a job offer in British Columbia isn\u2019t easy.

Tech Pilot programs are for engineers and technicians. This means your chances of finding a job that qualifies under this program are much greater if you possess an engineering degree or technician diploma.<\/p>\n<p>Your chances of being hired will also be much greater if you received this degree or diploma from a recognized Canadian university or college.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Possessing Work Experience&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%2396001c&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Technical positions and those in the engineering field are often given to candidates with extensive field experience. Program applicants have a better chance of securing a job offer if they possess many years of experience in their field. Having lots of experience can also make you a more attractive candidate than Canadian citizens and residents applying for the same position with less experience.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;A Well-Tailored Resume&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%2396001c&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]It may also help to apply for each job posting with the right resume.
