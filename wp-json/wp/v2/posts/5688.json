Both the programs are a part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/express-entry\/\"><strong>Express Entry system<\/strong><\/a> along with the <a href=\"http:\/\/elaarimmigration.ca\/canadian-experience-class\/\">Canadian Experience Class<\/a> (CEC).<\/p>\n<p>The two Canadian immigration programs, i.e. <a href=\"http:\/\/elaarimmigration.ca\/federal-skilled-trades-program\/\">Federal Skilled Trades Program<\/a> (FSTP) and Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), may be confusing for most applicants who do not understand the similarities and differences between the two. This blog would help you understand both the programs closely and determine which one is the best fit for you.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals will, in general, combine these two programs. There is a difference in the eligibility criteria of the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/blog\/how-to-use-the-federal-skilled-worker-program-for-immigration\/\">federal skilled worker<\/a><\/strong> (FSW) and that of the federal skilled trades (FST) program. The immigration procedure for preparing the two programs&#8217; application is electronic and depends on a point-based system. As these programs are part of Express Entry, applicants who rank higher in the comprehensive ranking system (CRS) are issued an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for Canada PR.<\/p>\n<p>For obtaining the Canada PR, one must qualify for the federal skilled worker points system. The federal skilled eligibility criteria include the applicant&#8217;s education, work experience, and language requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Now some of you may ask what Express Entry Pool is? The applicants who are willing to move to Canada make an online profile. If they qualify for one of Canada&#8217;s immigration programs, they enter the Express Entry Pool.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #000;\">In the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), an individual must have \u2013<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>At least 12 months&#8217; work experience in the last ten years.<\/li>\n<li>Only paid work is considered, and voluntary or unpaid work is not considered.<\/li>\n<li>The job has to belong to one of the NOC skill levels 0, A or B.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you did an all-day work, it must be equivalent to 30 hours of the week for a year, equal to 1,560 hours consistently. If it was a part-time job, it should be 15 hours out of each week for two years, equivalent to 1,560 hours. If one qualifies these requirements, he\/she would be able for the federal skilled worker points system.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #000;\">Whereas, in Federal Skills Trade Program (FSTP), the necessities are referenced underneath \u2013<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You should plan to live anyplace in Canada except for <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/quebec-immigration\/\">Quebec<\/a><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>You should meet the necessary level of language requirement either in English or French.<\/li>\n<li>You should have two years of full time or equivalent measure of part-time experience in the five years before applying under Express Entry.<\/li>\n<li>You should meet the job requirements as it is mentioned in NOC.<\/li>\n<li>You should have a full-time employment offer for at least one year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a candidate, you must show that you precisely performed the responsibilities at your job, as mentioned in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elaarimmigration.ca\/noc-code-canada\/\">National Occupation Classification<\/a> (NOC) list.
