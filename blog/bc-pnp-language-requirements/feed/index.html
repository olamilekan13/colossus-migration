					<description><![CDATA[Hi Hassan
I have the same situation. I received BC nomination for Skilled immigration under international post-graduate and now I am applying online through IRCC portal (through the nonexpress entry stream) and I see language requirement on the list. Did you find out whether it is required or not? because as per the BC website since international post-graduate doesn&#039;t require a job offer, proof of english requirement is not needed. Did you hear a clarification on the matter? please let me know]]></description>
