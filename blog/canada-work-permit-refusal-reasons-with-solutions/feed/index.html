					<description><![CDATA[My spouse is a regitered nuse (ICU). We are presently living and working in Doha Qatar. One of my daughter, she is 10 years old, she is having speech impairment and is undergoing speech and occupation therapy. Will it be a reason for my PR visa approval, if I apply through you. Because Nova Scotia from May1st is opening a lineint licensing process for us. Please advise. Regards, Satish (+974-55248565)]]></description>
