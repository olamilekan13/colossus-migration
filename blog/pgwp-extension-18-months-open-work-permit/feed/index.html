					<description><![CDATA[Good Day,

I received an email from IRCC last August 10, 2022 that I am eligible for an 18-month extension. Since I received that email, I did not do anything except to wait for another notification from IRCC on how to change my current mailing/residential address. It&#039;s almost the end of the year and I still have not received any update from them. What should I do now? My PGWP expired last October 28, 2022 but I have the interim work authorization until May 31, 2023.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Gabriel Invinzor Sibud]]></description>
